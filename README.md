# BackFeed Chrome Extension 

The Backfeed Chrome Extension enables value and reputation distribution according to the Backfeed model and protocols from within the Slack interface. 

## Main Functionality
A tool for a team to self govern by peer evaluation of contributions.
We achieve this by Integrating an evaluation layer above Slack that will enable these actions directly from Slack:

1. Submit a contribution
