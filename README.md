# BackFeed Chrome Extension 

The Backfeed Chrome Extension enables value and reputation distribution according to the Backfeed model and protocols from within the Slack interface. 

## Main Functionality
1. A tool for a team to self govern by peer evaluation of contributions.
2. We achieve this by Integrating an evaluation layer above Slack that will enable these actions directly from Slack:
3. Submit a contribution  
4. Browse contributions (using Slack native search for now)
5. Evaluate a contribution
6. View a contribution status
7. View a memberâ€™s status
### Additional Functionality
1. Start a project
2. keep collaborators updated and in sync with the valuation process by posting activities into Slack.
