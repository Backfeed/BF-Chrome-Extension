# BackFeed Chrome Extension Slack Client

The Backfeed Chrome Extension enables value and reputation distribution according to the Backfeed model and protocols from within the Slack interface. 

### [Download from the Chrome Store to play around with it](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/backfeed-slack-extension/gkefmbjinnbjnpagkphaebancjajfhbf)

## Disclaimer
The Chrome extension for Slack is **no longer** developed. Its goal was to enable people to submit and evaluate contributions directly from Slack. This UI hack doesn't use the standard integration methods recommended by Slack. While it can still be used "AS IS" in order to conduct experimentations with the Backfeed protocol, be aware that it is not maintained and that we do not provide warranty of any kind with respect to its compatibility with Slack and its performance.

## Main Functionality
A tool for a team to self govern by peer evaluation of contributions.
We achieve this by Integrating an evaluation layer above Slack that will enable these actions directly from Slack:

1. Submit a contribution
